Look It Up!
04 JUNE 2015 on Warmup, Problem Solving, Programming Principles, Level 2
Using objects, create a dictionary--list of words and definitions--that allows a user to make up words, save them, and look them up again.

Requirements:
Create a function that:
allows the user to enter new words and saves them into your object (be sure to pass the object in as a parameter). Does not allow duplicate words to be stored in the dictionary. This includes case-sensitivity.
Allows the user to look up words in the dictionary and see the definition of that word.
Extra-Extra-credit:
Do not allow any variation of the word to be saved as a duplicate. For example, if "brick" was entered your dictionary would reject "bricks" as a new word.
