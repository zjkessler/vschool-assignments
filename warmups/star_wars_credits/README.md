Star Wars Opening Credits ($http)
05 AUGUST 2015 on Warmup, HTTP/API, Web Applications, Level 2
You are going to make a one page Angular application that shows the opening words ("opening crawl") to Star Wars. The background should of course be black and have big yellow text.

You will use the Star Wars API to do this:

Extra credit:
Make the words crawl up the page from bottom to top

Extra extra credit:
Try to mimic the actual crawl from the movie as closely as possible. Here's a video for reference.



Triple extra credit:
Have the music play in the background while the crawl is going, and/or include the portion that says "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away", as per the video linked above.
