Requirements:

Create an object for a player that has the following properties:

name of type String
totalCoins of type Number
status of type String (options are Powered Up, Big,Small, and Dead)
star of type Boolean (Is a star active?)
setName of type function - sets name to "Mario" or "Luigi". Has a parameter called namePicked where you pass in "Mario" or "Luigi"
gotHit of type function - this is called whenever Mario is hit by an enemy. gotHit() will set the status property accordingly. (Statuses go from "Powered Up")
gotPowerup of type function - called when a powerup is received and sets the status accordingly
gameActive of type Boolean, true by default, becomes false when status is Dead

addCoin of function - adds a coin to totalCoins

print of type function - prints to the console the name, totalCoins, status, and star properties. Make sure you make this look nice such as:
Name: Luigi,
Status: Small, etc, etc
Create a random range function that returns either 0, 1, or 2.

If the value is 0 call the gotHit() function on the object. 
If the value is 1 call the gotPowerup() function on the object 
If the value is 2 call the addCoin() function

Then call the print function on the object.

Perform this random operation 3 different times and call that print function 3 different times.
