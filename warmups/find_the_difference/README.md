Create a function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of the items that are unique.

Given two sets (for example set A = [1, 2, 3, 7, 9, “Belly”, 20] and set B = [2, 3, 4, 8, 10, “jelly”]), find the set of elements which are in one of the two sets, but not in both.

The function should return an array of all the unique items.

If you complete this, do the extra credit. 
Extra Credit: Make it so that the function can accept any number of arrays, or an array of arrays, not just two.
