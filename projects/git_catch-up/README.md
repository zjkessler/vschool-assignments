We've already completed a bunch of warmups, exercises, and projects up to this point, but we haven't been keeping a very good backup or log of them.

Your task in this project is to complete the following:

Make sure everything you've done so far is organized according to the folder structure we discussed in class.
Create a README.md file for the assignments folder 
This README file should contain an explanation of what the purpose of this repository is. The text for this README can be found below.
Create README.md files for the warmup, exercises, and projects folders 
These README files should contain a generic explanation of what the warmups/exercises/projects folders are all about. The text for this README can be found below.
Create README.md files for each specific warmup, exercise, and project we've done so far 
These README files should contain some specifics about what topics you learned about/practiced in that warmup/exercise/project.
Folder structure
This is the folder structure you should be following as it pertains to organizing all of the assignments you're given at V School:

dev  
 |—— assignments
          |—— warmups
                  |—— hello-world-html
                          |—— <files for this project>
                  |—— hello-class
                  |—— etc.
          |—— exercises
                  |—— silly-cia
                  |—— grocery-store-js
                  |—— etc.
          |—— projects
                  |—— daily-planet-editor
                  |—— etc.
Assignments Folder README.md Text
You may use this text for the README.md file in your assignments folder:

V School Assignments  
====================

This is the main README file for all of my assignments from V School. Each of the directories in this directory represents a warmup (daily, short practices), exercise (completed immediately after learning a new topic), or a project (used to test my ability in given areas of development) that I've worked on during my time here. Each of these assignments has a README file that explains the assignment given as well as a summary of what I learned by completing the assignment.  
Warmups Folder README.md Text
You may use this text for the README.md file in your warmups folder:

Warmups  
====================

The warmups folder is a collection of the warmups we completed in class at V School. The purpose of warmups is to review and practice past material and prime us for learning new topics. Warmups are typically either quick problem-solving puzzles or small projects, and are usually completed within about 30 minutes or less.  
Exercises Folder README.md Text
You may use this text for the README.md file in your exercises folder:

Exercises  
====================

The warmups folder is a collection of the warmups we completed in class at V School. The purpose of warmups is to review and practice past material and prime us for learning new topics. Warmups are typically either quick problem-solving puzzles or small projects, and are usually completed within about 30 minutes or less.  
Projects Folder README.md Text
Projects  
====================

Projects are assignments specifically geared towards testing our ability to demonstrate an understand in a collection of topics. Projects represent a culmination both of topics that have been recently learned as well as those that have already been tested in the past. Passing a project is akin to "earning a merit badge" or "leveling up." As time progresses, the projects become more intense, as they naturally build off of everything we've learned up to the point of the project.

In the beginning, they're typically due in 1 or 2 days. Towards the end of the course, we're usually given 1 to 2 weeks to complete a project.  
Project Requirements
Passing Criteria: Visual inspection of the assignments repository on Github and Demonstration of adding a new assignment and pushing it to the repo
An instructor or TA will come by each student to make sure their repository is organized correctly, that the README files are in place and filled out, and that each student understands the process by which he/she updates the repository when new assignments come along.

This project passes off the following levels of the Skills Tree:
