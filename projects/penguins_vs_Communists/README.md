Penguins vs. Communists
20 JULY 2015 on Programming Principles, Level 3, Project
The year is 1950 during the Cold War. The Soviet communists are making plans to invade Antarctica. The penguins of the south aren't going down without a fight.

You will decide the fate of the penguins or communists through Javascript callbacks.

Project Requirements
Create two parties (Create a Javascript constructor function and use the new keyword to instantiate the parties)
Each party has a name ("Penguins" and "Communists" - or whatever you want)
Each party has a starting population of 1,000,000
Flip a coin (random number between 1 and 2) to see which party attacks first
Create a function called sendNuke(party, onHit, onMiss) where:
the first parameter party is the Javascript object of the party that will be attacked
the second parameter onHit is a callback function that will be called if the attack is successful
the third parameter onMiss is a callback function that will be called if the attack is unsuccessful
the onHit and onMiss functions each take one parameter of type party (just forwarding the party you already passed into sendNuke)
Print messages in the callbacks that are appropriate - e.g. if the attack missed then it would log "The Penguins' nuke missed the Communists and instead landed in the ocean" or something along those lines
A random algorithm will be used to determine if the attack is a miss or a hit (this can happen in the sendNuke function
If an attack is successful initiate a random damage amount
After an attack is completed (or missed) the opposing party will initiate an attack.
This process will repeat until one of the parties reaches a 0 population
Passing Criteria: Instructor or TA Code Review
An instructor or TA will sit down to code review your work and assess your understanding of the following topics:

Objects/Associative Arrays
Constructors or "Classes"
Callback functions
Functional programming concepts
Extra Credit
For a better user experience, add some delay between attacks using setInterval. You won't be able to do this inside of a loop, so you'll need to learn about clearInterval as well.
