Angular ng-model
21 JULY 2015 on Exercise, Angular, Web Applications, Level 1
Create a simple Angular website.

It should have 3 ng-model input elements and 3 two-way data-bound elements using the {{ nameOfVariable }} syntax. ("2-way data binding" is where the HTML text updates in sync with my typing in the input box. When you start typing in the input boxes, the corresponding elements should update.)

Try not to look at past angular projects while setting things up. Try to do it from scratch without help.

Use the Bootstrap CSS library. Use Bootstrap's well class to separate your controls to make the page look nice.

Use the Bootstrap grid system to make the app should be responsive and look nice on small screens.
