14 MAY 2015 on Week 1, Exercise, JavaScript, Programming Principles, Level 2
Loops help you reduce your lines of code when performing a task multiple times. Here you will learn how to use some of the different looping structures. Beware of infinite loops!

Write a program that accepts a string as input. Write a loop to print out each letter of that string individually.

Write a program that accepts a string as input. Then ask the user for a character. Write a loop that iterates over the string, and prints the position of the first occurrence of the specified character. If the character is not found, tell that to the user.

Write a program that accepts numbers (each on a new line) as input. Quit the program when the number 42 is entered.

Write a program that accepts 10 numbers (each on a new line) and then prints out the smallest number out of the ten.
