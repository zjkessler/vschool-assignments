You are going to create a website that allows users to post and upvote or downvote political issues.

Requirements:

Web page that shows a list of political issues
Each item will have a title
Each item will have a description
Each item can be upvoted or downvoted
Items will be ordered by upvotes (the most being at the top).
Each item should show the total number of votes
Web page will have a Post button that allows new posts
Users can comment on posts (unlimited number of comments per post)
On the back-end you will store all data in arrays or objects, no databases quite yet
Use Bootstrap
Use Angular for the front-end
Use Node/Express for the back-end
Clearly you will need the ability to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE

This is, more or less, a fully functional front-end and back-end application (minus the persistent database).
