Exercise - Angular Name Badge
22 JULY 2015 on Exercise, Angular, Web Applications, Level 1
Using Angular and Bootstrap create a website that looks/works like this:



Requirements:

The input fields should NOT directly update the badge fields (meaning when you type in the input box you should NOT see the badge field update - only after the Submit button is pressed will the fields populate.
Write code to make sure each field is not empty and has at least 3 characters each
If any of the input fields are empty the Submit button should be disabled (see ng-disabled)
Write validation code to make sure the phone number field only has numbers (no dashes or special characters, must look like this 9757653323
Web page must be responsive using Bootstrap
Must build HTML from scratch
Optional
Store new name Badges in an array and display them using ng-repeat. Meaning each time you submit a new badge it instantly appears in the list
Make the color of the badge heading background alternate on each list item (ie Red, Blue, Red, Blue (see ng-class)
