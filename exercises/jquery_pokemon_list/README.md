jQuery Pokemon List
16 MAY 2016
Using jQuery and the Pokemon API, create a cool-looking website that uses AJAX to grab a list of all pokemon. (This can be found at http://pokeapi.co/api/v1/pokedex/1/).

The site should list all of the pokemon's names in a neat, organized way. (Don't just put them in a <ul> or <ol>, but have them in some kind of inline-block organization structure so they wrap. You are allowed to use bootstrap if you want.

Extra Credit: Make it so a click to any one of their names does a goole search for their name.
