CIA Realizes It's Been Using Black Highlighters All These Years

Director Demands Investigation 

[ Main image: http://o.onionstatic.com/images/articles/article/1848/CIA-Realizes-C_jpg_250x1000_q85.jpg ]

LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.

According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.

CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: 

* the Cold War
* the civil-rights movement 
* the growth of the international drug trade

Hints
Best practice: CSS should be completely separate from the pure HTML. While it is possible to make CSS inline and even in the HEAD of an HTML file, most of the time it is best if all the CSS is in its on file, and then linked to in the HTML file. This allows us to have multiple HTML pages in a website that use the same styles. To link a CSS file to your HTML file, use the following code:

<link href="path_to_your_css_file" rel="stylesheet">
