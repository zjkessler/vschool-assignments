			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer"><b>Arnold Palmer</b></a> brought a country club sport to the masses with a hard-charging style, charisma and a commoner's touch. At ease with both presidents and the golfing public, and on a first-name basis with both, "The King" died Sunday in Pittsburgh. He was 87.</p>

		<p>Alastair Johnson, CEO of Arnold Palmer Enterprises, confirmed that Palmer died Sunday afternoon of complications from heart problems. Johnson said Palmer was admitted to the UPMC Hospital on Thursday for some cardiovascular work and weakened over the last few days.</p>

		<p><i>"Today marks the passing of an era,"</i> said Johnston, Palmer's longtime agent at IMG. <i>"Arnold Palmer's influence, profile and achievements spread far beyond the game of golf. He was an iconic American who treated people with respect and warmth, and built a unique legacy through his ability to engage with fans."</i></p>
